# Simple_Scheduler

This is a program that mimics how an operating system dynamically schedules tasks on a single process system. In addition to that, it also uses two pipes to pass information.<br>
In the docs folder it holds the test file and the expected outcomes. <br> 
There is also a how-to-use makefile run command in the file. <br>
